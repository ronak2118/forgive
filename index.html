        <h1>I'm So Sorry, My Love üíî</h1>

        <p>
            I know I messed up. I said things I didn‚Äôt mean and behaved in ways I‚Äôm ashamed of.<br>
            It breaks my heart knowing I made you feel hurt, unloved, or disrespected.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are not just my wife ‚Äî you are my best friend, my soulmate, my everything. Hurting you is the last thing I ever want to do.
        </p>

        <p>
            I‚Äôve been sitting alone, thinking about how I‚Äôve taken your kindness for granted, your patience, your love. 
            And I realize now how lucky I am to have someone like you in my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            I miss the way you laugh, the way you look at me when I say something silly. I miss your hugs, your voice, your presence around me. 
            The silence without you is painful, and it only reminds me of what I did wrong.
        </p>

        <div class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è üòò üíã</div>

        <p>
            I don‚Äôt want to be the reason for your tears. I want to be the reason you smile every day. I want to be the man who lifts you up, supports you, and loves you unconditionally ‚Äî not the one who breaks your heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every moment we‚Äôve shared ‚Äî the late-night talks, the silly jokes, the warm embraces ‚Äî they are pieces of my heart. 
            And I want to protect those memories, not damage them with carelessness.
        </p>

        <p>
            I promise to grow. I promise to pause and think before I speak. I promise to never let my ego speak louder than my love. 
            I promise to be better ‚Äî not just for you, but for *us*.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please give me the chance to prove that I can love you in the way you truly deserve ‚Äî with gentleness, respect, and depth. 
            I know it may take time, but I am ready to earn your trust again.
        </p>

        <div class="heart">üíñ</div>

        <p>
            So here I am, writing this from the heart, hoping that when you read these words, you feel my soul speaking to yours. 
            Hoping that despite everything, you still feel the love I have for you. Because it‚Äôs real. It‚Äôs deep. It‚Äôs forever.
        </p>

        <p>
            I‚Äôm sorry, my love. I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm waiting. And I‚Äôll never stop loving you.
        </p>
